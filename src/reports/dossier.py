Build the report dossier/view-model from a run snapshot.

This module owns the orchestration that combines:
  - deterministic context derivation from the SQLite snapshot
  - narrative overlays (synthesis, findings, tensions)

The renderer should stay presentation-only and consume the dossier returned
here without needing to know about snapshot internals.
