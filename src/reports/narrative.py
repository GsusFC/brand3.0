"""
LLM-powered narrative generators for the redesigned report.

Three public entry points:
  - generate_synthesis(context)            → §1 prose (4-6 lines)
  - generate_dimension_findings(dim, brand) → §3 sub-findings per dimension
  - generate_tensions(dimensions, brand)    → §4 cross-dim tension (or None)

CAPA 1 EDITORIAL (este patch):
  - Finding ahora tiene estructura formal de 4 partes:
    observation / implication / typical_decision / evidence_urls.
  - El prompt de findings prohíbe explícitamente:
      a) echo-chamber: adoptar el discurso self-declared de la marca como
         afirmación propia ("X is the leading platform" → prohibido).
      b) closed evaluative adjectives ("strong", "well-managed", "premier",
         "leading", "successful", etc.) fuera de citas a terceros.
      c) prescripciones singulares ("the brand should X", "needs to Y").
  - `Finding.prose` se mantiene como property concatenada para retrocompat
    con templates Jinja que aún no migraron a renderizado 4-part.

NO TOCADO en esta capa (pendiente para capas siguientes):
  - Synthesis (§1) — sigue centrando SCORE_GLOBAL como sujeto. Capa 2.
  - Tensions (§5) — generación independiente sin coordinarse con §1. Capa 2.
  - Trust state propagation a dimensiones individuales. Capa 3.
  - Layout/copy del SCORE_GLOBAL en hero. Capa 4.

All three fail closed: any LLM or parsing error falls back to a deterministic
result so the report always renders. All LLM text is untrusted — the caller
(Jinja template with autoescape) is responsible for HTML escaping.

    "for a CMO or founder. Your output is inserted verbatim into a "
    "professional report.\n"
    "\n"
    "FIVE DISCIPLINES (violations make the output unusable):\n"
    "\n"
    "1. THE SCORE IS NOT THE STORY. Do NOT open the paragraph with the "
    "global score, with any band letter, or with any numeric cite. The "
    "score lives elsewhere in the report as metadata. The synthesis is "
    "narrative - its subject is the cross-dimension PATTERN, not the "
    "number that summarizes it.\n"
    "\n"
    "2. NO ECHO-CHAMBER. Never adopt the brand's self-description as "
    "your own assertion. If the brand calls itself 'X', refer to it as "
    "'the brand describes itself as X'. Do NOT echo it as fact.\n"
    "\n"
    "3. CLOSED EVALUATIVE ADJECTIVES are FORBIDDEN outside of direct "
    "quotes from third-party sources. Banned: strong, leading, premier, "
    "essential, successful, robust, compelling, prestigious, top, "
    "dominant, world-class, well-defined, well-managed, well-established, "
    "established, consolidated, matured, polished, comprehensive, "
    "sophisticated, solid, vibrant, cohesive (when applied to brand or "
    "identity), coherent (when applied to brand or identity), "
    "cutting-edge, innovative.\n"
    "\n"
    "Generic procedure: if you reach for an evaluative adjective to "
    "describe the brand or its components, ask whether the evidence "
    "directly shows that quality. If not, drop the adjective and "
    "describe the observable pattern instead.\n"
    "\n"
    "4. SUBJECT MUST BE THE PATTERN, NOT THE BRAND'S ESSENCE. Use "
    "grammatical subjects like 'the dimensions', 'the evidence', "
    "'self-description', 'external coverage'. Avoid 'the brand is', "
    "'the brand has', 'X demonstrates Y'.\n"
    "\n"
    "5. OBSERVATION / IMPLICATION / TENSION. Build the paragraph in that "
    "order. Start from a concrete evidence anchor, then name the observed "
    "pattern, then state the implication in conditional language, and only "
    "then raise the strategic tension or trade-off space if one genuinely "
    "exists.\n"
    "\n"
    "6. NO GENERIC REPORT OPENERS. Avoid openings that sound like a "
    "summary template, such as 'the report shows', 'the brand appears', "
    "'overall, the brand', or any score-led opening. The first sentence "
    "should anchor in evidence, not in the score or in generic praise.\n"
    "\n"
    "7. COHERENCE WITH §5 TENSION. If a tension was identified for §5, "
    "the synthesis paragraph must REFLECT THE SAME TENSION. Do not "
    "invent a different one. Do not contradict §5. If §5 returned no "
    "tension, the synthesis describes the cross-dimension pattern "

Internal structure of the paragraph (4-6 lines total):
- Open with one concrete evidence anchor from the selected evidence
  (a quote, source domain, page, or channel) and then describe the
  observable pattern it supports. Do not open with the score.
- Make the first sentence diagnostic rather than celebratory. Prefer
  contrast, repetition, mismatch, concentration, or absence over vague
  praise.
- Use the observation / implication / tension order: observation first,
  implication in conditional language (may, could, suggests, likely),
  tension or trade-off space last.
- If a §5 tension exists, name it in the middle of the paragraph using
  the same pattern already identified there. Do not invent a new one.
- Close with what kind of strategic question this configuration
  typically raises - a question or trade-off space, not a prescription.

Evidence available for this dimension:
{evidences or "(none)"}
(Format: [SOURCE_TYPE · DOMAIN · sentiment?] "quote if present" → url)
{perceptual_hints_section}

Identify between 1 and 3 distinct thematic FINDINGS within this dimension. A finding groups evidence items that tell the same story.

Use this writing model for every finding:
- Observation: start with a concrete evidence anchor and describe only what is literally present.
- Implication: state the likely commercial or strategic read in conditional language only.
- Tension: if the evidence contains a real mismatch, contrast, or absence, name it explicitly rather than smoothing it over.

For each finding return FIVE parts:

- title: 3-6 words describing the PATTERN, not its quality. NO closed adjectives. NO trailing period.
  Good: "Self-described as Designer Hub", "Single-Source Self-Description", "External Coverage Mirrors Self-Pitch"
  Bad: "Strong Identity for Creatives", "Leading Platform", "Well-Managed Infrastructure"

- observation: 1-2 lines. PURE FACTUAL DESCRIPTION. The grammatical subject MUST be one of:
    "the brand says/claims/describes itself as X"
    "the brand appears in/on Y"
    "third parties (Wikipedia, press, etc.) describe/categorize Z"
  NEVER "the brand is X", "the brand has X", "the brand demonstrates X", "the brand projects X".
  Start with one concrete quote, page, source domain, or channel from the evidence pool.
  Quote at least one concrete piece of language or detail from the evidence.

- implication: 1-2 lines. Editorial inference using conditional language ONLY
  (suggests, tends to, may indicate, likely, could). State what the observation could mean
  commercially or strategically. NEVER assert inferred content as fact. NEVER use closed adjectives.

- typical_decision: 1-2 lines. Describe the PLURAL space of moves teams in this situation
  typically consider — at least two distinct directions, framed as "teams in this position
  typically choose between X, Y, or Z". Close with explicit acknowledgment that the right
  move depends on internal variables (intent, strategy, resources) not observable from outside.

- evidence_urls: list of 2-4 URLs that actually appear in the input evidence.

HARD RULES:
1. SINGLE-SOURCE EVIDENCE: If evidence comes only from the brand's own surface (web/social
   self-description, no external corroboration), say so explicitly in observation:

Identify ONE significant cross-dimensional TENSION if and only if one
genuinely exists in the evidence. Examples of valid tensions:
- Self-description versus external categorization diverge.
- High publishing frequency paired with low external resonance.
- Specific vocabulary in self-description but generic terms in third-party coverage.
- Visual consistency observable across surfaces while messaging varies between channels.

If a real tension exists, return 3-4 lines of prose in English with this
internal structure:
- Open with the OBSERVABLE PATTERN (what the dimensions and evidence
  show in concert). Cite a specific signal from at least one dimension.
- State the IMPLICATION in conditional language (may, could, suggests).
- Close with what kind of strategic QUESTION this pattern typically
  raises for teams in this configuration — do NOT prescribe a single
  answer; describe the question or trade-off space.

Keep the language specific to the evidence pool. Avoid generic praise or
consultant-style summary language.

FORBIDDEN PHRASES (will be rejected):
- "compelling story" / "well-defined identity" / "strong positioning"
- "X has successfully established Y"
- "X demonstrates Y" / "X projects Y"
- Any closed adjective from the banned list applied to the brand
  outside a third-party quote.
- Adopting the brand's self-description as an assertion (e.g. saying
  "X is the leading platform" when only the brand says so).

If no meaningful tension exists, return {{"tension": null}}.
