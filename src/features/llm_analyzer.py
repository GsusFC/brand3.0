LLM-based brand analysis.

Uses LLM to make subjective judgments that keyword matching can't:
- Is the brand's language unique or generic?
- What category/positioning does the brand claim?
- How does third-party perception compare to self-description?
- What are the brand's distinctive concepts?

Provider is configured via src.config (OpenAI-compatible API).
