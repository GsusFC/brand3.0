"""Shared pytest setup for the Brand3 test suite.

Isolates unit tests from any real LLM provider: the default analyzer used by
`src.reports.narrative` is stubbed out so that `None` always propagates,
which in turn routes every narrative call through its deterministic
fallback. Tests that want to exercise the LLM path must pass an explicit
`analyzer=<mock>` argument — see `tests/test_reports_narrative.py`.
